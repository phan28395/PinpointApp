# Group 1: The "Global Self" (Application-Wide Actions)

Psychology: These actions relate to the application's very existence and its connection to the operating system. They are global, persistent, and should always be accessible but unobtrusive.

Where they belong: The System Tray Icon.

This is the perfect home for functions that manage the application as a whole, because the tray icon is always present but stays out of the way of the user's main work.

    Left-Click: Show/Hide the main "PinPoint Studio" window (as it does now). This is the primary global action.

    Right-Click Menu:

        Project Layout -> (A submenu listing your most recent or favorite layouts for quick projection).

        Show/Hide All Projected Tiles <space> Hotkey
        Make overlappable/unoverlapable (the word here still need to be redefine) <space> Hotkey
        Switch project to another monitor  <space> Hotkey
        Start at Startup
        Settings / Preferences... (to open a future global settings window).

        --- (Separator) ---

        Quit PinPoint
