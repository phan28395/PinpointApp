# PinPoint Refactoring Guide

## Project Overview
PinPoint is a desktop application for creating floating widgets (tiles) that can be positioned anywhere on screen. The current implementation needs refactoring to separate tile logic from visual design, enabling third-party designers to create custom tile appearances without touching the code.

## Architecture Goals
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Tile logic must be completely separate from visual presentation
2. **Design System**: Implement a centralized design system with consistent tokens
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Support for third-party tile types and designs
4. **Design Constraints**: Enforce rules to ensure tiles remain functional regardless of design
5. **JSON-based Designs**: Visual designs defined in JSON files that can be created without coding

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Basic plugin system exists (plugin_registry.py)
- ✅ Design system foundation present (design_system.py)
- ✅ Tile manager supports design concepts
- ⚠️ NoteTile still has embedded UI code
- ⚠️ Design validation not fully implemented
- ⚠️ No design editor/preview system
- ⚠️ Limited design documentation

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Start with Phase 1 - Core architecture is critical
2. Phase 2 and 3 can be worked on in parallel
3. Phase 4 can begin after Phase 1 is complete
4. Phase 5 should wait until Phase 3 is done
5. Phase 6 is ongoing throughout development
6. Phase 7 is final preparation

### Key Files to Modify
1. `note_tile.py` - Remove all UI code
2. `base_tile.py` - Enhance design rendering
3. `plugin_registry.py` - Add design validation
4. `design_system.py` - Expand component library
5. Create new: `design_validator.py`, `design_renderer.py`, `design_editor.py`

### Breaking Changes
- Tile data structure will change (add design_spec field)
- Plugin API will be extended (not broken)
- Storage format will need migration
- Some custom user modifications may break

### Success Criteria
- Designers can create new tile appearances without coding
- All tile types work with any valid design
- Performance remains good with complex designs
- Third-party designs can be easily installed
- Design creation is well-documented

## Notes for Next Session
When continuing this refactoring:
1. Check the current state of the codebase
2. Review completed items in this checklist
3. Continue with the next unchecked item
