## Session 1 - 30/06/2025

### Overview
Successfully completed Phase 1.1 - Complete Logic/UI Separation for NoteTile. The implementation achieves full separation of business logic from UI presentation.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Connection Pattern**: Instead of creating UI components, NoteTile now searches for components created by the design system using `get_component()` method. This allows complete flexibility in design while maintaining functionality.

2. **Default Design Loading**: Enhanced BaseTile to automatically load default designs from the plugin system when no design_spec is provided. This ensures backward compatibility.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: When the required "noteTextEdit" component isn't found, the tile logs a warning but doesn't crash, allowing designers to create display-only note tiles if desired.

### Implementation Details

The separation works as follows:
- `NoteTileLogic` handles all business logic (content management, debouncing, updates)
- `NoteTile` acts as a bridge, connecting the logic to whatever UI the design provides
- `BaseTile` handles all UI creation based on design specifications
- Designs can be provided inline or loaded from the plugin system

### Challenges Faced

1. **Initial Approach**: The original code had UI creation embedded in a method called `_create_default_design()`. This had to be completely removed.

2. **Component Discovery**: Needed a reliable way for NoteTile to find its text widget after the design system creates it. Solved by using Qt's `findChild()` with the component ID.

3. **Testing**: Created a comprehensive test script to verify the separation works with various design scenarios.

### Bug Fix During Testing

During testing, discovered an initialization order issue in NoteTile. The callback was being set before the parent class was initialized, causing a RuntimeError. Fixed by moving `set_update_callback()` to after `super().__init__()`. This ensures the object is fully initialized before method references are passed around.

This fix is critical for the update mechanism to work properly, which is essential for content synchronization between the studio and live tiles.
### Next Steps

With Phase 1.1 complete, the next logical step is Phase 1.2 - Enhance BaseTile Design Rendering. This includes:
- Implementing all component types from the ComponentType enum
- Adding layout managers (horizontal, grid, etc.)
- Implementing component property binding
- Creating a proper component factory

The foundation is now solid for building a complete design system on top of this separated architecture.
