This plugin_registry.py provides the foundation for your extensible tile system. Here's what it does:
Key Features:

Plugin Discovery:

Loads built-in plugins from pinpoint/plugins/
Loads user plugins from ~/.pinpoint/plugins/
Automatic discovery of TilePlugin subclasses


Metadata System:

Each plugin declares its capabilities, category, version, etc.
Config schema for validation
Author attribution for community plugins


Capability-Based System:

Tiles declare what they can do (edit, refresh, integrate, etc.)
UI can adapt based on capabilities


Configuration Management:

Default configurations
Schema-based validation
Merging of defaults with instance data


Safety Features:

Error handling for bad plugins
Validation of tile classes
Signals for load status


Factory Methods:

create_tile() - Creates tile instances
create_editor() - Creates editor widgets
Handles all the complexity of instantiation



How it enables your goals:

Scalability: New tile types just need to implement the TilePlugin interface
User Creativity: Users can drop Python files in ~/.pinpoint/plugins/
Balance: Built-in plugins are curated, user plugins are sandboxed to the API
Categories: Helps organize tiles (Productivity, Media, Data, etc.)
