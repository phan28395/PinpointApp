## Session 1 - 30/06/2025

### Overview
Successfully completed Phase 1.1 - Complete Logic/UI Separation for NoteTile. The implementation achieves full separation of business logic from UI presentation.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Connection Pattern**: Instead of creating UI components, NoteTile now searches for components created by the design system using `get_component()` method. This allows complete flexibility in design while maintaining functionality.

2. **Default Design Loading**: Enhanced BaseTile to automatically load default designs from the plugin system when no design_spec is provided. This ensures backward compatibility.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: When the required "noteTextEdit" component isn't found, the tile logs a warning but doesn't crash, allowing designers to create display-only note tiles if desired.

### Implementation Details

The separation works as follows:
- `NoteTileLogic` handles all business logic (content management, debouncing, updates)
- `NoteTile` acts as a bridge, connecting the logic to whatever UI the design provides
- `BaseTile` handles all UI creation based on design specifications
- Designs can be provided inline or loaded from the plugin system

### Challenges Faced

1. **Initial Approach**: The original code had UI creation embedded in a method called `_create_default_design()`. This had to be completely removed.

2. **Component Discovery**: Needed a reliable way for NoteTile to find its text widget after the design system creates it. Solved by using Qt's `findChild()` with the component ID.

3. **Testing**: Created a comprehensive test script to verify the separation works with various design scenarios.

### Bug Fix During Testing

During testing, discovered an initialization order issue in NoteTile. The callback was being set before the parent class was initialized, causing a RuntimeError. Fixed by moving `set_update_callback()` to after `super().__init__()`. This ensures the object is fully initialized before method references are passed around.

This fix is critical for the update mechanism to work properly, which is essential for content synchronization between the studio and live tiles.
### Next Steps

With Phase 1.1 complete, the next logical step is Phase 1.2 - Enhance BaseTile Design Rendering. This includes:
- Implementing all component types from the ComponentType enum
- Adding layout managers (horizontal, grid, etc.)
- Implementing component property binding
- Creating a proper component factory

The foundation is now solid for building a complete design system on top of this separated architecture.

## Session 2 - 30/06/2025

### Overview
Successfully completed Phase 1.2 - Enhance BaseTile Design Rendering. The implementation provides a complete component creation and layout system that supports all planned component types and enables third-party extensibility.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Component Factory Pattern**: Implemented a factory pattern for component creation, allowing plugins to register custom component types without modifying core code.

2. **Layout Factory**: Separate factory for layouts supports different layout managers (vertical, horizontal, grid) with consistent property handling.

3. **Property Binding System**: Implemented a weakref-based binding system that allows tile data to automatically update UI components without tight coupling.

4. **Event Mapping**: Generic event mapping system that translates Qt signals to tile actions, maintaining the separation between UI and logic.

### Implementation Highlights

1. **All Component Types**: Successfully implemented all ComponentType enum values:
   - label, button, text_edit, line_edit
   - icon (supports emoji and image files)
   - image (with scaling options)
   - progress (horizontal and vertical)
   - slider (with tick marks)
   - checkbox (with tristate support)
   - container (recursive nesting)
   - spacer (for flexible layouts)

2. **Grid Layout Support**: Full CSS Grid-like support with row/column positioning and spanning.

3. **Nested Layouts**: Containers can have their own layout type, enabling complex UI structures.

4. **Component Registry**: Each created component is registered by ID, allowing efficient updates and queries.

5. **Custom Styling**: Components can have custom styles applied through the design spec.

### Testing Strategy

**Testing Philosophy**: Minimal Smoke Test (50 lines): Just enough to visually verify all features work. Manual Testing: For async features like property binding that require runtime observation. Examples Directory: Comprehensive examples moved to separate directory for reference.

### Extensibility Example

Created an example showing how plugins can register custom components:
- DigitalClockWidget - a custom clock display
- CircularProgressWidget - a circular progress indicator
- Registration mechanism that integrates seamlessly with the existing system

### Performance Considerations

1. **Component Caching**: Components are registered once and reused, avoiding recreation.
2. **Weak References**: Property binding uses weakref to avoid memory leaks.
3. **Efficient Updates**: Only affected components are updated when data changes.

### Next Steps

With the enhanced rendering system complete, the next logical step is Phase 1.3 - Strengthen Design Constraints System. This will add:
- Size constraint enforcement
- Required component validation  
- Nesting depth limits
- Version compatibility checking
- Better error messages

The foundation is now robust enough to support any UI design while maintaining the separation of concerns.

## Session 3 - 30/06/2025

### Overview
Successfully completed Phase 1.3 - Strengthen Design Constraints System. The implementation provides comprehensive validation of design specifications against tile-specific constraints with clear, actionable error messages.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **DesignValidator Class**: Created a separate validator class that encapsulates all validation logic, making it easy to test and extend.

2. **Error Display Strategy**: Instead of console warnings, validation errors are displayed directly in the tile with a visually distinct error panel. This ensures designers immediately see what's wrong.

3. **Constraint Source**: Constraints come from the tile plugin's metadata, allowing each tile type to define its own rules without modifying core code.

4. **Validation Timing**: Validation happens at render time, not at design load time, allowing designs to be loaded even if invalid (important for debugging).

### Implementation Highlights

1. **Version Compatibility**: Implements semantic versioning checks with clear rules:
   - Major version must match exactly
   - Minor version of design cannot exceed system version
   - Patch differences generate warnings only

2. **Size Constraints**: Automatically clamps sizes to allowed ranges rather than rejecting entirely, making the system more forgiving.

3. **Component Validation**: 
   - Checks allowed component types per tile
   - Validates required components are present
   - Tracks nesting depth recursively

4. **Error Presentation**: 
   - Scrollable error panel for long error lists
   - Color-coded display (red for errors, yellow for help)
   - Clear, actionable error messages
   - Professional appearance that doesn't break the tile

### Testing Approach

Created a single comprehensive test that demonstrates all constraint types:
- Each test case creates a tile with a specific violation
- Visual confirmation of error displays
- One valid design to show success case
- Tests can be run independently or together

### Next Steps

With Phase 1.3 complete, the core architecture refactoring (Phase 1) is finished. The next logical phase would be Phase 2.1 - Expand Design System Components, which includes:
- Adding remaining component styles
- Implementing theme inheritance
- Adding responsive sizing tokens
- Creating component state styles
- Documenting all design tokens

The constraint system now ensures that third-party designs will work correctly with tiles while providing clear feedback when they don't meet requirements.

## Session 4 - 30/06/2025

### Overview
Successfully completed Phase 2.1 - Expand Design System Components. The implementation provides a complete theme inheritance system and styles for all planned component types.

### Implementation Strategy

Due to the file size, the implementation was split into two parts:
- Part 1: Core classes, enums, and data structures
- Part 2: The DesignSystem class with all style methods

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Theme Inheritance System**: 
   - ThemeDefinition class with parent theme support
   - Built-in themes: default (dark), light, and glass
   - Themes can inherit all values from parent and override specific ones
   - Theme registry manages all available themes

2. **Responsive Values**:
   - ResponsiveValue class provides different values based on container width
   - Breakpoints: small (<200px), medium (<400px), large (>=400px)
   - Can be used for any numeric or string value

3. **Component States**:
   - All components now support state-based styling
   - States: normal, hover, active, pressed, focused, disabled
   - Proper visual feedback for all interactions

4. **New Component Types**:
   - Radio buttons with proper circle indicators
   - Combo boxes with custom dropdown styling
   - Spin boxes with integrated up/down buttons
   - Tab widgets with modern tab styling
   - Group boxes with floating titles

5. **New Style Variants**:
   - Glass: Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
   - Outlined: Border-only buttons for minimal design

### Design Decisions

1. **CSS-in-Python**: Kept stylesheet generation in Python for type safety and IDE support
2. **Theme Fallback**: Always falls back to default theme values if current theme missing a value
3. **State Styles**: Included in base style methods rather than separate to reduce complexity
4. **Version Bump**: Changed to 1.1.0 to indicate new features while maintaining compatibility
### Base Tile Updates

Completed the Phase 2.1 implementation by updating base_tile.py to support all new component types:

1. **Radio Buttons**: Support group names for mutual exclusion
2. **Combo Boxes**: Support items as strings or objects with data, editable mode
3. **Spin Boxes**: Full numeric input with prefix/suffix and special values
4. **Tab Widgets**: Complete tab management with nested component rendering
5. **Group Boxes**: Collapsible groups with title and layout support

The implementation maintains the same pattern as existing components, making them immediately available to all tile designs. Each component properly applies the design system styles based on variant and size parameters.

### Event System Extensions

Extended the event mapping system to handle:
- `toggled`: For radio buttons and checkable elements
- `current_changed`: For combo boxes and tab widgets
- `tab_close_requested`: For closable tabs
- `item_selected`: For future list/tree widgets

This completes Phase 2.1 - all planned components now have full style and functional support.

### Next Steps

The design system is now feature-complete for Phase 2.1. The next step would be to update base_tile.py's ComponentFactory to support the new component types (radio, combo_box, spin_box, tab_widget, group_box) so they can be used in actual tile designs.

After that, Phase 2.2 would involve creating the design validation framework with JSON schema support.
