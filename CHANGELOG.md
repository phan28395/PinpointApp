## Session 1 - 30/06/2025 - Successfully implemented
**Phase**: 1.1 - Complete Logic/UI Separation for NoteTile
**Duration**: 45 minutes

### Files Changed
- **Modified**: `note_tile.py` - Removed all UI creation code, now relies entirely on design system
- **Modified**: `base_tile.py` - Added default design loading and enhanced component creation
- **Created**: `test_note_separation.py` - Test script to verify the separation works

### Breaking Changes
- NoteTile no longer creates QTextEdit directly
- NoteTile requires a text_edit component with id "noteTextEdit" in the design
- Custom NoteTile subclasses must be updated to use the new pattern

### Key Improvements
- Complete separation of logic (NoteTileLogic) from UI (design specs)
- NoteTile now works with any design that includes a text_edit component
- Default designs are loaded from the plugin system
- Graceful handling when required components are missing
### Additional Fix
- **Modified**: `design_system.py` - Fixed parameter passing issue, added size parameter to text_edit_style

## Session 2 - 30/06/2025 - Phase 1.2 Complete
**Phase**: 1.2 - Enhance BaseTile Design Rendering
**Duration**: 60 minutes

### Files Changed
- **Modified**: `base_tile.py` - Complete rewrite with enhanced design rendering system
  - Added ComponentFactory for extensible component creation
  - Added LayoutFactory supporting vertical, horizontal, and grid layouts
  - Added PropertyBinding system for data-UI binding
  - Added support for all ComponentType enum values
  - Added event handler mapping for complex interactions
  - Added component registry and custom component registration
- **Modified**: `design_system.py` - Added styles for new components
  - Added line_edit, icon, progress, slider, checkbox styles
  - Added combo_box style for future use
  - Enhanced validation to check nesting depth
  - Added transparent style variant
- **Created**: `test_phase_1_2_minimal.py` - Minimal smoke test (50 lines)
  - Verifies all new component types render correctly
  - Tests grid layout with column spanning
  - Tests nested container layouts
  - Tests event handling
  - Provides visual confirmation of implementation success

### Breaking Changes
- Component specifications now support more properties (grid positioning, events, bindings)
- Layout specifications now require a 'type' field
- BaseTile now expects components to have IDs (except spacers)

### Key Improvements
- Complete separation of component creation from BaseTile class
- Plugins can now register custom component types
- Full support for complex layouts including grids
- Property binding allows automatic UI updates from data changes
- Event mapping allows components to trigger tile actions
- Component factory pattern enables extensibility
