# Group 1: The "Global Self" (Application-Wide Actions)

Psychology: These actions relate to the application's very existence and its connection to the operating system. They are global, persistent, and should always be accessible but unobtrusive.

Where they belong: The System Tray Icon.

This is the perfect home for functions that manage the application as a whole, because the tray icon is always present but stays out of the way of the user's main work.

    Left-Click: Show/Hide the main "PinPoint Studio" window (as it does now). This is the primary global action.

    Right-Click Menu:

        Project Layout -> (A submenu listing your most recent or favorite layouts for quick projection).

        Show/Hide All Projected Tiles <space> Hotkey
        Make overlappable/unoverlapable (the word here still need to be redefine) <space> Hotkey
        Switch project to another monitor  <space> Hotkey
        Start at Startup
        Settings / Preferences... (to open a future global settings window).

        --- (Separator) ---

        Quit PinPoint

# Group 2: The "Library" (Creation & Management Actions)

Psychology: These actions relate to the "wellspring of potential"—the user's raw library of tiles and layouts. They are about creating, organizing, and managing the building blocks before they are used.

Where they belong: The Left Sidebar of the Studio.

The controls should be physically close to the lists they are manipulating.

    Buttons at the Top of the Sidebar:

        ＋ New Tile (opens the dialog to create a new tile definition).

        ＋ New Layout (creates a new, empty layout).

    Right-Click Menu on a Layout Item:

        ▶️ Project this Layout

        ✏️ Rename

        📋 Duplicate

        🗑️ Delete Layout

    Right-Click Menu on a Tile Item in the Library:

        ✏️ Edit in Studio

        📋 Duplicate Tile

        🗑️ Delete Tile Permanently
